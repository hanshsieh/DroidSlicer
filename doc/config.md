# Configuration #
In this chapter, we will illustrate the configuration of our system.  
The configuration files are stored in directory **config**.  

For each supported Android API version, there's a directory **apiXXX** in the directory. There should be at least **apiXXX** directory. During analysis, our tool will select the library version that best fit for the need of the app.

In the following, the purpose of each files in the directory will be illustrated.

**config/logback.xml**   
The configuration file for the logging library [logback].

**config/sensitive_behavior_signature.xml**  
This file define the sensitive behavior signatures for matching with the app. For the meaning of a sensitive behavior signature, see the paper.
For the detail, see [here](sb_sig.html).

**config/android/apiXXX/**  
This directory contains the configuration files for Android api version XXX.  

**config/android/apiXXX/libs/**  
This directory contains the Android Library files. All the *.jar files in this directory will be loaded as library files in lexicalgraphical order of the file names. The classes in the latter ones will overwrite the classes in the former ones.  

**config/android/apiXXX/pscout/**   
This directory contains the files generated by [PScout]. These files aren't used during analysis, but can be used by some entry points of our tool to parse these files into the format accepted by our system.

**config/android/apiXXX/api_permissions.xml**  
See [here](api_permissions.html).

**config/android/apiXXX/entry_points.xml**  
See [here](entry_points.html).

**config/android/apiXXX/intent_permissions.xml**  
See [here](intent_permissions.html).

**config/android/apiXXX/listeners.txt**  
See [here](listeners.html).

**config/android/apiXXX/method_summary.xml**  
See [here](method_summary.html).

**config/android/apiXXX/method_summary_helper.jar**  
See [here](method_summary.html).
